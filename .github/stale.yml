  Hi there — thanks for submitting this talk! It’s been a year since the last activity — would you mind taking a look to see if you’re still interested in presenting about this topic, and if the talk’s content is still up-to-date?

  **If everything’s still good,** just drop a comment here and I’ll pop back into hibernation like a good little robot.

  **If you’re no longer interested in giving this talk,** or the talk is out-of-date, feel free to close this issue.

  Should I not hear back in a week, I’ll close this issue so you needn’t feel guilty about it. ❤️

  Thanks for your contribution to the tech community in DC!
